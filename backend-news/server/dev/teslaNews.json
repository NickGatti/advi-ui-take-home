Analysts are expecting that S & P 500 earnings will fall 5.2% in the first quarter, followed by a 4% decline in the second quarter. The outlook is darker still for mid- and small-cap stocks, with midcap profits to narrow by 19.3% and smallcap earnings tumble by 23.5%. However, JPMorgan thinks the stock market's profit problem isn't so much a short-term issue as it is one oriented around the back half of the year. Investors may hear more next week about whether the job cuts already enacted in the tech sector have helped companies meet their targets or whether still more layoffs are needed.",

Consumers are squeezed by higher living costs, making them more cautious and surgical with purchasing decisions, resulting in less discretionary spending. Retail sales for March were down 1%, compared to February, reflecting a slow-down in consumer spending as expected. Nonstore sales were higher than last month’s, with the most significant declines in discount stores, department stores, and home improvement. Consumer price index (CPI) up 0.1% in March after increasing 0.4% in February, but inflation for the year remains high. The Federal Reserve recently set its benchmark rate, which determines borrowing costs across the U.S. economy, at 4.75 percent to 5 percent, with another quarter-percentage-point increase expected in May. Retailers must face decisions in the near future on how to fund a growing business if interest rates and product costs are higher.",

The proposal does not require a specific number of electric vehicles be sold every year, instead mandating limits on greenhouse gasses. U.S. car buyers registered more than 1.45 million electric vehicles in the calendar year ending Dec. 31, 2021, according to the latest data available from the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The EPA projects at least 60 percent of new passenger vehicles sold in the United States would be electric by 2030 and up to 67 percent by 2032. The proposed standards are expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 56 percent from existing standards for the model year 2026, and 46 percent will be new vehicle sales in 2032. The proposal is expected to be finalized next year, and includes tax credits for EV manufacturing and purchases included in the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act passed last year.",

The White House and its allies said the proposal would help reach the tougher requirements, including stricter pollution rules, tax credits for EV manufacturing and purchases. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing automakers, called the proposal “aggressive by any measure” and wrote that it remains enough to support electric vehicle sales.",
